title: Ooh, Shiny! New look and a more comprehensible Scriptus
---

The trunk version of Scriptus now uses bootstrap to look non-completely-ugly, H2 which has several significant benefits over Derby (performance, restartability), and Hibernate which seems more dependable than Eclipselink for now.

In addition to that, there is now a "Feedback" page that makes it easy to sends me your thoughts should you so choose, and a simple process admin page.

And finally! The most obvious change is that the Scriptus home and "about" pages try and do a better job of explaining what, precisely, Scriptus /does/. Many of the conversations about Scriptus and similar projects like [human.io](http://human.io/) are of the form "nice, but what is it for?", and these pages are an attempt to explain that for Scriptus.

In the immediate future I intend to make the Twitter account per-user but keep the Twitter app key per install.
