title: Ooh, Shiny! New look and a more comprehensible Scriptus
---

The trunk version of Scriptus now uses [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) to look non-completely-ugly, [H2](http://h2database.com/) which has several significant benefits over Derby (performance, restartability), and [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) which seems more dependable than EclipseLink for now. Due to this, the docs on GitHub are now out of date and will be reviewed shortly.

In addition to that, there is now a "Feedback" page that makes it easy to sends me your thoughts should you so choose, and a simple process admin page.

And finally! The most obvious change is that the Scriptus home and "about" pages try and do a better job of explaining what, precisely, Scriptus /does/. Many of the conversations about Scriptus and similar projects like [human.io](http://human.io/) are of the form "nice, but what is it for?", and these pages are an attempt to explain that for Scriptus.

In the immediate future I intend to make the Twitter account per-user but keep the Twitter app key per install.

The new version of Scriptus is also available to download as an executable war file at a new location: [Scriptus 0.5.0](http://iansopublic.s3.amazonaws.com/scriptus.war).
