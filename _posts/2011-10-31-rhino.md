I've fixed [fixed several continuations- and serializing- related bugs in Rhino](https://github.com/ianso/rhino), which are also available [on my own fork of Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pull/15) while the patches work their way into the main Mozilla trunk.

Until that point, and with some help from this [post on setting up Maven repos on GitHub](http://chkal.blogspot.com/2010/09/maven-repositories-on-github.html), which is probably not best practise, I've pointed Scriptus at my own custom 'microrepository' containing these fixes. That means that things like `eval(get("url"));` now work, and that you can confidently modify the prototypes of basic objects like `Number` and not have your changes disappear when a continuation occurs.
