title: What next
---

The ['future'](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/blob/master/docs/future.md) doc is quite ambitious and long-winded but given the speed, or lack thereof, at which I work on Scriptus, some more modest goals need to be put in place for now.

Scriptus had quite a bit of attention but very little feedback when it first launched, and I guess that the reception was of a "great, but what does it *do*?" nature. So, I'm going to make some adaptations that will make it easier to get started, and easier to play around in an online sandbox.

This will involve fixing the Twitter integration to use OAuth more as it was meant to be used, and removing the unintuitive hashtag-based reply mechanism. Finally the internal admin interface needs to be rethought and redesigned to look better, more like a web site, and less like an application console.
