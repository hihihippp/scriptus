title: Per-process transports, bye-bye to the command line, and Facebook
---

In the latest version of Scriptus, you can now choose a transport on a per-process basis, instead of configuring one global transport for the whole application. 

I've also removed the "command-line" transport and replaced it with a web-based "Personal transport" - you can find it under a tab in the transports section. This allows you to test scripts before running them in public, or to run scripts in private.

In addition to this, I've merged in the work done by Andres Perez during one of his projects at Politecnico di Milan. The code is there, but not live, since Scriptus has changed a lot since the work was done - I merged now to avoid even more pain in future.

The latest version of Scriptus can be found in the usual place:  [Scriptus 0.8.0](http://iansopublic.s3.amazonaws.com/scriptus.war).
