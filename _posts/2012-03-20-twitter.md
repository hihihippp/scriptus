title: Twitter integration improved
---

Scriptus has been changed so that when someone replies to an `ask()`, the "in-reply-to" tweet ID is used instead of a random hashtag generated by Scriptus. This is a fairly significant improvement, but one for the better, and it breaks backwards compatibility with "Scriptus 0.1.0". For this reason I hereby announce Scriptus 0.2.0.
