title: New backend database for Scriptus
---

A new version of Scriptus has been on the trunk for a couple of months (sorry for the late news!) that contains a significant change. The filesystem and SDB/S3-backed datastores have been removed and replaced with a datastore that uses an embedded database, [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/), to store processes etc. In the nightly branch Derby is replaced with H2.

The "embedded" part is cleanly separated from the actual database access, which uses JPA. This means that in future, using different databases should require a minimum of effort.

This will make some things easier, like simple process admin, and better migration between versions of Scriptus.

Right now I'm working on making the Scriptus "admin" site look better and do a better job of explaining what Scriptus is.

In the immediate future I intend to make the Twitter account per-user but keep the Twitter app key per install for now.

The trunk is actually broken right now, but a merge from nightly will soon fix that.
