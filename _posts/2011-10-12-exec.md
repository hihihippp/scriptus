title: UNIX-style exec() added
---

Since Scriptus programs run for a long time, and their source cannot be modified once running, then a 'small pieces loosely joined' style of composing systems would seem to be a good approach. With this in mind, a UNIX-style `exec()` call has been added. The API documentation has been updated as usual. Thanks to [Nathanael](http://nathanaeljones.com/) for the conversations leading to this idea.

Since I went live I've been adding plenty of new features, as you can see in the blog archives. They've been added at the slow rate as warrants a spare-time project, but each call was surprisingly quick to add. For example, `exec()` was maybe 10 lines of added code, not counting the test-cases.

The time has come to focus on some bugs. Specifically, there are [two bugs in Rhino](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-rhino/t/4dd522e2689705bb) and one in [Datejs](http://www.datejs.com/) that I would like to try and fix, so if this blog isn't updated for a while, it's because I'm wrestling with the guts of Rhino. Which sounds disgusting really but I'm sure it isn't.
