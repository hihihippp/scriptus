title: A new example, long-term reminders
---

Apart from some more Rhino fixes and one to the sadly-dormant DateJS, I've been dogfooding! [This reminders example](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/blob/master/scripts/reminder.js) shows how easy it is to create programs that run for decades or more while remaining interactive. A short discussion of the program can be found on the [examples page](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/blob/master/docs/examples.md).
