This document explains in nitty-gritty detail how to start, set up and run the Scriptus application server, along with a suggested development lifecycle for developing Scriptus programs.

#Running Scriptus

Scriptus requires JDK 6 to run. You can download & setup the OpenJDK, or obtain the latest proprietary version either from Oracle or IBM. The IBM JDK should work but hasn't been tested.

Next, [download and install Maven 2](http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation) from the Apache website.

Once Maven is configured,  either download Scriptus as a [zip](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/zipball/master) or [tar](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/tarball/master) file, or make a checkout using Git.

You can use Maven to run Scriptus, or compile it into a WAR file that should be deployable in any standard Servlet container such as Tomcat.

To run Scriptus using Maven, use the following command in the Scriptus directory:

`mvn jetty:run`

To compile Scriptus, use the following command:

`mvn clean install`

You will then find a WAR file under the "target" directory.

By default Scriptus writes log files to "logs" under the Scriptus directory. This location is initially defined using a relative path. The location can be configured in `src/main/resources/log4j.properties`.

#Scriptus administration

Scriptus has a very primitive admin tool that allows users to save, edit and delete programs, and to run saved programs. By default this tool is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/), if you run Scriptus in Maven. The tool asks users to identify themselves using OpenID, as a simple way of allowing multiple users to store and run their programs on the same server.

The OpenID identification can be disabled by putting `disableOpenID=true` in the config file.

#Configuring Scriptus

When you are running Scriptus, the first thing you will probably want to do is go to the settings page and configure Scriptus. If you've run Scriptus using Maven, this will be at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/settings](http://127.0.0.1:8080/settings). This page provides a very simple interface for editing the Scriptus configuration file.

This file is by default stored in `~/.scriptus/config.properties`. If you want to keep it somewhere else, then you can provide a `scriptus.config` system property to specify the location:

`mvn jetty:run -Dscriptus.config=/etc/scriptus.conf`

All of the options in the configuration file can be edited via this interface except for the `disableOpenID` property described in the previous section.

The two major configurations for Scriptus are choosing where to store your data, and how to interact with people (the 'transport').

##Choosing a datastore

The datastore is responsible for persisting saved programs and running program state. There are three implementations and they all have their uses.

 *   **In-memory** storage keeps everything in memory. When Scriptus is shut down or restarted everything vanishes.
This storage method is used for running test cases in the Scriptus source code, but can also be useful if you're debugging scripts offline that you've written & saved elsewhere.

 *   **Local file-system** storage saves everything on disk on the same computer on which you're running Scriptus.
This can also be fine for testing, but is also fine if you're running Scriptus on your own server. If this is the case, backup, fault-tolerance etc. is the responsibility of the server administrator.

 *   **Amazon AWS** storage saves everything in the online services Amazon S3 and Amazon SDB, which have the advantage of being scalable and highly redundant without you having to do anything about it. On the other hand, it's a for-pay service, although Scriptus stores only a few kilobytes of data per script and per running process, so it should be very cheap.
Using AWS also means that programs cannot be run offline, for obvious reasons. 

##Choosing a transport

The transport is the means via which Scriptus programs interact with their users. There are three mediums and they all have their uses.

 *   **Dummy response** just responds with "response" to every `ask()` and not at all to a `listen()`.
It can be useful for testing simple scripts. In future a more flexible dummy will be put in place to allow for better automated testing of scripts.
 
 *   **Command prompt** sends all `ask()`s and `listen()`s to the command line, where the local user can respond.
To *not* respond simply hit enter when you're prompted for your response.
 
 *   **Twitter** is used to interact with users on Twitter.

##A note on Twitter

On Twitter, people are asked questions using @mentions and questions are tracked using #hashtags. Responses are sent back to Scriptus in the same way. Anything after "//" will be ignored. For example:

1. @robotoscriptu tweets `@ianso #ef3hED electing HOW many presidents-for-life?!`
2. @ianso tweets `@robotoscriptu #ef3hED 4 //but I can depose them whenever I want!`

In the above exchange, the hashtag `#ef3hED` is used by Scriptus to match the reply from `ianso` to the question asked by `robotoscriptu`. `ianso` has replied "4".

At present, Twitter prevents users from sending identical status updates within a certain time period. This can sometimes present a problem for Scriptus if a running program needs the same input twice. In this case, adding something random after a "//" will make the status update unique enough for Twitter.

#Programming with Scriptus

Scriptus programs are stored on a per-user basis and saved using the admin tool. Scriptus programs interact with the outside world via [the Scriptus API](https://github.com/ianso/scriptus/tree/master/docs/api.md).

When a Scriptus program is run, it can be supplied with two parameters:

`owner` - The screen name of the script owner. 
 
This is the person with whom ask, say & listen will interact with by default, and the person to whom the result of the root process will be said.

`args` - The program arguments.
 
This is a variable length string that can be anything you want. For example, in a script that runs a game tournament, the arguments could be `-game chess -players 2 -competitors 20`.
 
Both variables are usable inside the Scriptus program as `owner` and `args` respectively.

#Developing and testing your program

In writing the example programs for Scriptus there are one or two tips and tricks that I've found handy. Debugging is generally not fun, but it would be kind of a drag to have a program run for a month and then crap out with an error, when it should be running for another year. So without further ado, some suggestions:

 *  **Write your programs in a text editor and use SCM.** Scriptus doesn't do version control and only offers primitive syntax highlighting in its built-in editor, ACE. So treat yourself to a decent text editor when writing Scriptus programs, and upload the finished version when you're ready to test.

 *  **Run programs with the command-line transport and in-memory storage first.** That way you can test out your program in private, without making a mess in your twitter feed or on your hard-drive.
 
 *  **Use `listen()` instead of `sleep()`.** That way you can tell the running program "OK stop waiting and carry on".

 * **For durations, use constants. For dates, use arithmetic and isolate it in one place.** You can easily change these constants to smaller durations during testing and longer ones when running the program for real.
 
 * **Processes are (relatively) cheap, so use them liberally if it simplifies your code.** In a normal program, too many processes leads to CPU contention and resource exhaustion. In Scriptus, a sleeping or waiting process uses no memory or CPU, only storage space, generally kilobytes per process. With this in mind, I think it's fine if you want to launch 100 processes to run a questionnaire for 100 different users, for example.
 
 * **Use `log()` statements.** Without them, since there is not currently a debugger, it's very difficult to tell what your program is doing. See [this Stack Overflow question on logging best practices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/270651/what-guidelines-do-you-adhere-to-for-writing-good-logging-statements).

That's all for now. If you have more, please send them in, so we can all benefit from the wisdom of collective experience :-)

##A note on JavaScript

Scriptus programs are written in JavaScript. If you're already familiar with programming, but haven't written much JavaScript, [Mozilla's "a re-introduction to JavaScript"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) is a good place to start.

If you're completely new to programming then [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentJavaScript.net/) is a highly recommended book that is also available online for free. Alternately you can [learn JavaScript very easily using interactive lessons at Codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/). Finally, [this Stack Overflow question on learning JavaScript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11246/best-resources-to-learn-JavaScript) lists many other resources.

The way to return a result from a function in JavaScript is to use the `return` keyword, however in one of the odd quirks that JavaScript is famous for, `return` may not be used at the top-level of a JavaScript program, and instead the last variable to be evaluated is taken as the return value of the program. As a convenience to the programmer, who can always use `return` where expected, Scriptus programs are wrapped in a function before being executed as follows:

```JavaScript
function ___scriptus___ () {
	//your code will go here
}
```
