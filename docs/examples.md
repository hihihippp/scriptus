#Scriptus example programs

There are a variety of example programs for Scriptus in `src/scripts`, and some of them are even useful. Below, some of them are listed along with a brief discussion in each case of how they use Scriptus.

##`addTwoNumbers.js`

This example is a simple illustration of `fork()` and asks two people, `adam` and `bart` for a number each and relays the addition to a third person, `carole`.

Worth pointing out is two things: firstly that the final result is both numbers concatenated (20+10=2010), since the results of each ask() is a JavaScript `String`, and secondly that the full version of each function call is used. This is like using `window.alert()` and `window.prompt()` in client-side JavaScript on a web browser.

##`knockknock.js`

I like this one not just because it's the first program for Scriptus that I didn't write, but also because it has a sense of humour.

At the risk of ruining the joke, I think it works on multiple levels: first of all it's actually telling a joke to somebody in a traditional call-and-response format. But funnier than that, I think is that the "caller" in this case is a soulless automaton who will bug the "responder" indefinitely until the *properly spelt and grammatically correct* response is received *promptly* for each of the two calls.

Of course, running this program on someone who's not in on the joke would probably not be funny to them.

##`reminder.js`

This program sets up a series of reminders to a given user for an event in the future. In contrast to a calendar reminder, it will send multiple warnings: one day before, one week before, one month before, six months before, and once a year until your event takes place.

Notable features include:

 * A combination of `get()` and `eval()` is used to effectively create an "import" statement. This means the script has to run with web access, which may be a problem e.g. during testing.

 * One process is used for creating each of the reminders. For an event 100 years from now this would mean 100 processes, but this has no impact on Scriptus except the storage costs of each process until it wakes. The reminders can be cancelled at any time, at which point the reminder processes are killed.
