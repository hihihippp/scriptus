While I was thinking about the kind of programs I could write with Scriptus, I realised that my general concept of 'execution' was quite limiting, because it limited me to in-memory processes. Once execution can happen anywhere, like in the XKCD cartoon(http://xkcd.com/505/), we can use it for anything, on any scale.

For example, how an election works is common knowledge. The process of nomination, candidature, campaigning and voting takes months, but is procedurally simple at heart.  How do we write a program that that will let anybody run an election?

The right answer is to write the program and then think about how to run it.

This is some that Tim  O'Reilly 







The Long Code Manifesto

Computers run faster and faster. But in the real world, anything important takes time and effort to achieve.

If our goal is to make the world a better place, then we need to learn to code on a world-changing scale.

Therefore, we should not think of /execution/ as being a transient, in-memory process of computation.

Programs that change the world will run for years or decades, so they can't reside on any one computer, and they need to stick around.

The challenge is to write programs for the long term. Write programs that run for months, years or decades.

Their input and output will be our thoughts and actions, and they will work with us first, computers second.

Because computers can't change the world. We can.

X	Suggestions from Jenya
X	** features that would be nice
X	API
X docd	- get + post should expose response headers to script & allow headers to be specified.
X docd	- pipe(function(in, out){})?
X docd	  - say & listen to ids
X docd	- post()? etc?
X docd	- location & multimedia APIs
X docd	  look(); //photo upload
X docd	  where(); / at(); / near(); //location: coordinates
X docd	on root process termination, 
X docd	 - child processes should be re-parented, 
X docd	     - and when they terminate, what happens if their output has not been waited upon?
X docd	Timeout on listen() should make one last check before returning null to program	
X docd	remove listener registered on timeout
X docd	CID not stored per-user, too small a namespace for a big deployment (if that ever happens)...
X docd	scheduler is imprecise. use paging
X docd	kill - fix problem with running processes
X docd	   - needs time-machine to test properly...
X docd		 - test-bed with time-machine built in. How? should be mirror-image of script.
X docd	view source principle for scripts (using snapshotted debugger info from rhino)
X docd	online REPL / dev environment?
X docd	 - problem is doing fork & wait in browser JS, where there is no thread model (maybe with narcissus + cloning for fork)
X	   --> investigate how pipes & stdin/out works in UNIX
X docd	->keep view source principal: tools are scripts
X docd	 - from Sander, user admin
X docd	 - from Jenya, how to integrate with existing services & web-applications?
X docd	 - from Jenya, i.e. use it as workflow engine or store state of process
X docd	   - bind outputs to normal command?
X docd	Future directions inspired by UNIX
X docd	   procfs?
X docd	 - filesystem, read/write/open
X docd	 -> what gets mounted and how?
X docd	  /proc for admin, /bin with standard tools? (VSP!)
X docd	->REPL : pipe commands, e.g.
X docd	$ poll "Are widgets splunkable?" yes no
X docd	$ elect 2 "widget experts" | debate "Should widgets be splunked?"
X docd	lessons learnt from reminders.js:
X docd	 eval(get) means your script has to run onlne 
X docd	 -> good reason to have a filesystem
