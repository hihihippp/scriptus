##`reminder.js`

This program sets up a series of reminders to a given user for an event in the future. In contrast to a calendar reminder, it will send multiple warnings: one day before, one week before, one month before, six months before, and once a year until your event takes place.

Notable features include:

 * A combination of `get()` and `eval()` is used to effectively create an "import" statement.

 * One process is used for creating each of the reminders. For an event 100 years from now this would mean 100 processes, but this has no impact on Scriptus except the storage costs of each process until it wakes. The reminders can be cancelled at any time, at which point the reminder processes are killed.

medium	
	Amazon AMI for playing with Scriptus
low
	pids should be URNs: "pid:12345";
	docs: easy to write annoying, difficult to be considerate...
	move outstanding stuff to github tasks

	*************BUGS
docd	on root process termination, 
docd	 - child processes should be re-parented, 
docd	     - and when they terminate, what happens if their output has not been waited upon?
docd	Rhino bug: eval(get("")) doesn't work, var s = get(""); eval(s); does.
docd	Timeout on listen() should make one last check before returning null to program	
docd	remove listener registered on timeout
docd	CID not stored per-user, too small a namespace for a big deployment (if that ever happens)...
docd	scheduler is imprecise. use paging
docd	kill - fix problem with running processes
	      - children list should be managed separately (SDB?)
	         - might as well separate state out too...
	         - add status column
	      - processes not deleted properly on wait / termination
	      
	Future directions inspired by UNIX
	 - filesystem, read/write/open
	 -> what gets mounted and how?
	  /proc for admin, /bin with standard tools?
	->keep view source principal: tools are scripts
	->REPL : pipe commands, e.g.
	$ poll "Are widgets splunkable?" yes no
	$ elect 2 "widget experts" | debate "Should widgets be splunked?"

	Suggestions from Sander
	 - email interaction medium
	    - pop3 or imap?
	 - multiple transports per script: use transport option
	 - import/export functionality for DAO
	 - process table
	    -> via procfs?
	 - user admin
	
	Suggestions from Jenya
	 - how to integrate with existing services & web-applications?
	 - i.e. use it as workflow engine or store state of process
	   --> investigate how pipes & stdin/out works in UNIX
	    --> read() and write()
	 
	

	
	site
	 - index.html & default layout re-use CSS & HTML
	 - site doesn't work locally and on github due to "/scriptus" relocation

	test twitter integration
	   - listen
	DAO API versioning... important for evolution!

**running track of compromises & known bugs
	script bodies wrapped with (new function(){...})() at compile time
	two concepts of identity: one via openId, one via twitter. Unify?
	 scriptus AWS DAO should store process state separately - it's updated by itself all the time
	 nonce should be extended to all continuations?
	  - avoid double-acting? or if the server is shut down mid-execution, allows recoverability?
	 
** features that would be nice
	API
	- pipe(function(in, out){})?
	  - say & listen to ids
	- post()? etc?
	- get + post should expose response headers to script & allow headers to be specified.
	view source principle for scripts (using snapshotted debugger info from rhino)
	testbed should include "time-machine"
	 - centralise clock
	public or shared scripts in the admin interface
	online REPL / dev environment?
	 - problem is doing fork & wait in browser JS, where there is no thread model (maybe with narcissus + cloning for fork)
	regexp based responses in dummy

X	write basic script that does maths, returns 2+2

X	 - fix object lifecycle
X	 - decision: to have script source separated per user, but executions in a global namespace:
X	     - stupid or not?
X 	         no, because' of processes are per-user, then the correlation IDs have to 
X		return a user-UUID instead of just a UUID.
X seems OK? - script security
X not for now	 - public scripts?
X	 - real DAO
X		 - blob &

X test	 - file-based DAO

X no	 - duration arithmetic?
X test	 - process scheduler (with queue, mutable execution properties)
X	       - internSource is in two places
X KEEP	         - scriptusAPI, 
X		 - scriptProcess.create
X	         + assigning in wait.js, oh my!
X	       - test with new scriptusapi...
X	       - load fails?
X	other stuff
X test	 - don't forget to empty cidpid map, which should be per user or notat all
X	listen needs timeout
X yes    - does moving to a queue system, then altering the properties of the queue, 
X yes      give greater control e.g. in test-cases than just directly executing stuff?
X test	    - parameterise scheduling (not going to test twitter with hours of timeout...) 
X test	       - annoying: if I'm not willing to debug with putatively-final values for durations,
X test	         why should I expect anyone else to? In other words, why seconds for me debugging
X test	         and hours for everyone else? implies this will be necessary:
X test	         GRR
X test	         ^([0-9]+)[\\ ,]*([smhdwMqyDC])$
X test	 seconds	minutes	hours	days	weeks	fortnight	months	quarters	years	decades	centuries

X	id is composed of:
X	    * time - 41 bits (millisecond precision w/ a custom epoch gives us 69 years)
X	    * configured machine id - 10 bits - gives us up to 1024 machines
X	    * sequence number - 12 bits - rolls over every 4096 per machine (with protection to avoid rollover in the same ms)
X fixed	the interaction / scheduler interface is not clean;
X fixed	 - cids should be uniquely dealt with by interaction medium to track
X	schedulers: not reporting error messages
X	 + queue?
X	-> s3 404s...
X test	     - incomings
X test	     - scheduled check

X test	     - store origin id with correlation?
X test	     - processed mentions
X test	     - tweeting undefineds
X test	 - command-line medium is not thread-safe
X test	 log file locations
